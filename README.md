# Music as a Mirror: Predicting Tonal Languages with Machine Learning  

## Overview  
Tonal languages utilize **pitch variations** alongside consonants and vowels to convey meaning, making them unique in their phonetic structure. While traditionally studied through a linguistic lens, their **musical dimension remains underexplored**.  

This project investigates the **intersection of music and tonal languages** by applying machine learning to predict whether a song belongs to a tonal language based on pitch-related features.  

The work builds on and improves the research of **Minh Nguyen**, who served as a mentor and guide throughout this project.

## Research Goals  
- Explore whether **musical pitch features** can distinguish tonal from non-tonal languages.  
- Develop and evaluate **machine learning classifiers** using audio features.  
- Investigate potential **applications** in language education, speech recognition, and automated language identification.  



## Dataset  
- **125 songs** collected from tonal and non-tonal languages.  
- Covers diverse **regions, languages, genres, and time periods**.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted pitch contours, harmonic structures, and frequency variation using audio signal processing.  



## Methods  
- **Feature Extraction:** Pitch tracking and signal-processing for musical attributes.  
- **Models Tested:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Random Forest  
  - Neural Networks  
- **Validation:** 10-fold cross-validation with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.  


## ðŸ“Š Results  
| Model               | Cross-Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression  | **0.65**                  | **0.64**      |
| SVM                  | 0.61                      | 0.60          |
| Random Forest        | 0.59                      | 0.58          |
| Neural Network (MLP) | 0.60                      | 0.59          |  

Findings confirm that **songs in tonal languages exhibit distinct pitch patterns**, paving the way for broader interdisciplinary research at the nexus of **linguistics, music, and AI**.  



## Contributions
